  <p>I am someone who likes to know the cause behind things, behaviour and actions. They really intrigue me
    as to how they function. I'm also a big fan of data science and how the industry is growing at a tremendous
    speed. It will be unrecongnizable in 50 years.</p>

          This is the same code as table header. We can put it here, yet there will be no
          difference in the website, as browsers are able to differentiate between table header Cell
          and Table Data Cell. Automatically, Table Header Cell is considered as title.
